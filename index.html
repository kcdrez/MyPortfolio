              <p>
                During my tenure at Scribd, I had the opportunity to collaborate with a diverse group of professionals, including engineers, testers, designers, and product managers. Our collective objective was to create and maintain Slideshare, a widely-used platform that facilitates the sharing of slideshows, documents, and infographics among professionals and students. Slideshare has a substantial userbase, with thousands of individuals accessing it on a daily basis.
                <br><br>
                One of my key contributions was migrating the frontend of the product from a jQuery infrastructure to a modern React framework. Additionally, I implemented advertisements within the product, which allowed us to transition from a subscription-only userbase to a free model supported by advertisements. We utilized AB testing to optimize user engagement and explore different revenue options.
                <br><br>
                In my position, I worked closely with the design team to bring their ideas to life. They would create visual mockups using Figma, and I would then translate their requests into actionable tasks utilizing a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) implementation model. This involved creating or updating the backend infrastructure using Ruby, retrieving the required data from databases, and delivering it to the frontend through a GraphQL API. On the React frontend, I utilized the API, conducted unit and integration tests using Cypress, and made necessary adjustments to the CSS files to ensure precise adherence to the mockup, with a special emphasis on mobile-friendly design.

              <p>
                Nacelle developed a product that enhances clients' online stores, leading to improved conversion rates, increased user engagement, and ultimately higher profitability. My role involved developing a fully customizable dashboard for clients, giving them the ability to add products, change prices, update store layouts, and integrate with their existing Shopify or Contentful accounts.
                <br><br>
                Working closely with designers, engineers, and product managers, we ensured a smooth operation of our product. We developed a user-friendly platform utilizing the VueJS framework, Vuex state management, and performed unit and integration tests with Jasmine. In addition, I collaborated with backend engineers who developed a GraphQL API. Together, we leveraged LaunchDarkly to implement an advanced feature flag system, enabling us to customize user experiences based on client pricing models. We also followed a CI/CD development cycle to efficiently and continuously enhance the product.

              <p>
                I was a member of a team responsible for maintaining the user portal designed to assist mortgage applicants and lenders in accessing and submitting their mortgage applications. Our product consisted of two versions: one for applicants to complete their personal information and apply for loans, and another for banks and mortgage lenders to view and manage these applications. Our team had a crucial role in ensuring strict compliance with legal and privacy requirements pertaining to financial records and ADA guidelines.
                <br><br>
                I played a significant role in the development of the frontend portion of the product, which was utilized by numerous mortgage lenders. As part of this process, we had to incorporate specific features and limitations based on individual lenders and local regulations. Additionally, we successfully migrated the software from AngularJS to Angular 8, taking full advantage of the new Angular Material styling capabilities. I also played a key role in training junior engineers on the updated infrastructure and frameworks, ensuring the entire team remained well-informed and proficient in their use.

              <p>
                Dire Wolf Digital is a gaming company that specializes in the development of video games and board games. I had the privilege of working at Dire Wolf Digital for almost seven years and held various responsibilities during my tenure.
                <br><br>
                My journey began in the field of QA testing, where I demonstrated my competence and expertise by efficiently identifying long-existing bugs. Within a year, I was promoted to the position of Senior QA Tester, where I further honed my skills in testing new video game features. Eventually I progressed to the role of QA Lead, assuming the responsibility of overseeing a team of testers, devising test plans, implementing innovative testing practices, and collaborating with product managers to discuss forthcoming features.
                <br><br>
                While fulfilling the role of QA Lead, I also managed and updated our testing infrastructure. Using the functionalities of Excel's Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), I devised a system that enabled us to swiftly generate new test plans. However, given the company's expansion, this approach became increasingly cumbersome, necessitating the exploration of a more efficient solution.
                <br><br>
                During this transitional period, I trained my successor for the QA Lead position while embarking on a new project with a colleague. Together, we developed a highly customizable test plan suite, transitioning from Excel to a web-based interface. Initially, we utilized KnockoutJS for the frontend, but quickly migrated to VueJS. Together with my teammate, who was responsible for implementing the backend using ExpressJS and a MongoDB database, we collaborated closely to bring this project to fruition.
                <br><br>
                Upon committing myself to full-time development, our team was tasked with maintaining the company website. This included managing a newly implemented merchandise store using VueJS, PHP, and SQL. Additionally, we established an efficient process for other departments to generate dynamic content, eliminating the need for offline maintenance through the use of innovative technologies.

We also designed and implemented a mobile responsive interface for customers to purchase products using Vue.js. Additionally, we developed an internal tool to enable the marketing department to easily update product information, such as prices, images, and quantities, in real-time on the website.
                <br><br>
                I also improved the company's website to enhance its mobile responsiveness and accessibility on smaller devices by utilizing Sass. The website primarily utilizes PHP and jQuery, with some components incorporating Vue.js for enhanced user interactivity.

                To achieve this, I have integrated with an established third-party API to gather user's data. Additionally, I have created my own REST API that seamlessly integrates with Amazon's DynamoDB and Lamdas. For the frontend user experience, I utilize Vue.js v3 (including TypeScript), Vuex, Vue Router, and Bootstrap.

                I developed a utility tool for the <a href="https://sentinelswiki.com/index.php?title=Sentinel_Comics:_The_Roleplaying_Game_%E2%80%93_Core_Rulebook" target="_blank">Sentinel Comics RPG</a>, a tabletop role-playing game with a superhero theme. In this game, one player assumes the role of the Game Moderator (GM), who controls the environment and villains, while other players portray superheroes in their adventures. I initially created this application for my personal games, but I have received valuable feedback and feature requests from the Sentinels RPG community.
                <br><br>
                To build this tool, I utilized Vue.js, Vuex, and Bootstrap to create flexible and reusable components and employed effective data management techniques. Through this application, the GM can easily add minions and villains, include various locations and challenges, and efficiently track the movement of the players using a convenient virtual table integrated with FabricJS.

                The application utilizes a third-party API for accessing Pokémon information which allows users to easily search and explore various attributes of Pokémon such as type advantages and disadvantages, alternative coloring options (shiny), and the highest Combat Power (CP) for each type. I developed this application primarily for personal use and for sharing with colleagues to enhance our Pokémon Go gameplay experience.

            Besides being a web developer, I absolutely love hanging out with my amazing group of friends and beloved family. As a proud dad, I get immense joy from spending quality time with my little ones. Whether it's embarking on exciting escapades around our town, engaging in imaginative play at home, or getting our hands messy in the kitchen and whipping up delicious treats together, every moment spent with my family is an absolute treasure.

            One of my biggest passions is playing games. I have a whopping collection of over 100 board games that range from mind-bending sci-fi challenges to lighthearted and entertaining party games. Among them, my ultimate favorites are Spirit Island, where I can channel my strategic prowess, and Battlestar Galactica, which never fails to have us on the edge of our seats. Additionally, I adore diving into the immersive world of video games. Currently, my go-to is a captivating mobile Star Wars game, where I get to interact with beloved characters and even foster online friendships with fellow gamers. It's an absolute blast!
